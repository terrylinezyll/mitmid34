<h3 style="color: darkred">Fake humans</h3>
<p>Humans naturally live fake lives and are really messed up they have wrong
  judgment about things and end up making wrong choices </p>

<h3 style="color: sienna">Bad choices</h3>

most of the make them using feelings instead of their heads and hence make choices they
regret</p>
